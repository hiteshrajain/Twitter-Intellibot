# Twitter-Intellibot

Building your own Twitter bots allows you to take your Twitter presence to the next level. By using bots, you can automate content creation and other Twitter activities. This can save you a lot of time and give your audience a better experience.

The objective of our project is to create an intelligent bot associated to a specific twitter account that comes to play when the same account is tagged in a specific tweet by some other twitter user and replies back by targeting specific keywords.

We all know that this is a world of connectivity, internet, and social media. Everything is at our fingertips, just a click away. In this world where we are leading socially busy lives, we need someone who can act on our behalf and share the load.
This load sharing process is the basic reason behind the creation of our Intellibot using python.
